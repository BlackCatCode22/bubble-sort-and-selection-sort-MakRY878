Instructions:

Code up the bubble sort and the selection sort in Java.

Ask ChatGPT to calculate the Big O notation for each of your sorts and
have ChatGPT explain Big O notation!


Big O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It provides an upper bound on the time or space complexity of an algorithm in terms of the input size. Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. It is a key concept in the analysis of algorithms and is used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms in solving the same problem. Common notations in Big O notation include O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), and others, where n represents the input size.

So, the Big O notation helps us understand how the time it takes to do things changes when we have more and more stuff to deal with. It's like a special way to see how much time or effort something will take when we have a lot of things to do.
